# LPL505: Launchpadless 505

LPL505 is a small but powerful desktop application built to fully unlock and control the Boss RC-505mk2 loop station via USB MIDI. 

It can be used to replicate the [infinite fx changes technique](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gfB4Krj22I) without the need of a Novation Launchpad Pro MK3.

YT Tutorial on how to set it up and use it. (WIP)

## Features

- **Customisable Workspace:** Build an unlimited array of buttons and faders on a free-form, scalable UI canvas.
- **RC-505mk2-Specific design:** Buttons for the Infinite FX changes technique, general MIDI messages, or [MIDI program changes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67y-oijQv1A)
- **Save & Load Templates:** Share templates with your friends and load them up whenever you want.
- **Responsive & Smart UI:**
  - Toggle between "Edit" and "Perform" mode. Prevents accidental changes while live performing.
  - Fully resizable window with intelligent coordinate scaling.
  - A smooth free positioning / grid system with instant "Snap-All" capability.
  - Rubber-band multi-select and group dragging.
- **Aesthetic Customization:** 
  - Dark mode & Light mode
  - Custom user-imported background images.
  - Native OS Color Pickers for every widget, combined with a 
  - "Glow Intensity" system for live visual trigger feedback.
- **MIDI Clock Quantization:** Delay a trigger impact until the "Next Beat" or "Next Bar", or quantize to stay perfectly in time with the mk2's internal clock.

This app works specifically with a Boss RC-505mk2 connected via USB. You **must** install the provided `.RC0` memory files to your loop station for the app markers to function correctly.

1. Connect your RC-505mk2 to your computer in **Storage Mode**.
2. Navigate to the `ROLAND/DATA` folder on the RC-505mk2 drive.
3. Copy the 2 memory files from the **[resources/boss-rc505mk2-presets](./resources/boss-rc505mk2-presets)** folder of this repository into your machine.
